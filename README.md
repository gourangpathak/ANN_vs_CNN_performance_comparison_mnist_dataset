# ANN_vs_CNN_performance_comparison_mnist_dataset
In this model I have used a an Artificial Neural Network to do digit recognition, further I have also created another model using a convolutional neural network and compared the performances of the two models

## Dataset has been taken from tensorflow, keras :
